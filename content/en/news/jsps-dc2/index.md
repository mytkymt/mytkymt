I am pleased to announce that I have been accepted to the JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (DC2) program.

The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (DC2) is a prestigious fellowship program designed to support doctoral students in their second year or later. The program aims to foster the development of excellent young researchers by providing financial support for their research activities and living expenses.

As a DC2 fellow, I will receive a monthly stipend of 200,000 yen for living expenses, along with an annual research grant of up to 1,500,000 yen (including indirect costs) to support my research activities.

The fellowship period will begin in April 2026 and continue for two years.
