I'm excited to announce that I have started a visiting research at the [Morphing Matter Lab](https://morphingmatter.org/) at UC Berkeley from October 13, 2025 to December 11, 2025.
The Morphing Matter Lab is a research group led by Professor [Lining Yao](https://morphingmatter.org/member/lining-yao) that focuses on the discovery and study of morphing material mechanisms, and algorithms for their computational design and fabrication pipelines. The lab is interested in applications that contribute to planetary and human wellbeing.

During my visit, I will be collaborating with the lab members on a projects related to FoodHCI. I look forward to learning from this innovative research environment and contributing to ongoing projects.
